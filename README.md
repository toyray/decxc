## decxc

Utility to read the binary CXC files for the game [ChronX](http://chronx.com/index2.php) in Intel x86 ASM.

ChronX seems to be dead as of December 2015; I may remove this repo if it's back online.

Format of encrypted CXC file and decrypted card data are documented in [cxc_file_format.md](cxc_file_format.md) and [ccc_file_format.md](ccc_file_format.md) respectively.

Requires [MASM32 SDK](http://www.masm32.com/) for assembly and linking.
